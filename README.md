1-Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?

The DriverPass project involved designing a comprehensive driver training system for a client aiming to enhance driver education and preparation for driving tests. The client, DriverPass, sought a system that could offer online classes, practice tests, and on-the-road training modules.

2-What did you do particularly well?

One area where I excelled was in working on my Use Case diagram;, I believe that aspect of the project turned out exceptionally well.

3-If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

If I could choose one part of my work on these documents to revise, I would pick the UML class diagram. 
I feel that I rushed through completing it, and I would improve it by taking more time to ensure thoroughness and accuracy in depicting the class relationships and attributes

3-How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

Interpreting user needs through direct engagement and feedback, system designers can create interfaces, functionalities, and workflows that are intuitive, efficient, and aligned with user goals.

4-How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

When approaching software design, I begin by gathering requirements and identifying the core problems the software needs to solve. After that, I will create diagrams (such as class diagrams, sequence diagrams, and use case diagrams) to visualize system components, their interactions, and data flow. In the maintenance phase includes ongoing support, updates, and enhancements to keep the software secure and aligned with user needs and technological advancements.
